Task:

A program that inputs a sequence of numbers with a space and asks the user for any number.

You can check if the input condition is the same as the input condition.

The program then works according to the following algorithm:


-converting the entered sequence into a list


-sorting the list by the ascending order of the elements in it (to implement sorting, define a function)


-set the position number of the element, which is less than the number entered by the user, and the next one is greater than or equal to this number.


-when setting the item position, use the binary search algorithm that has been discussed in this module. Implement it also as a separate function.
